FTS performance is faster than SQL LIKE query because it doesn't have to scan the whole table in order to find certain terms.
FTS only returns exactly the terms itself, While SQL like query return all the terms that contain the tokens.
However, FTS cost more disk volume compared to sql like query and takes longer to populate the table.
